# Avery's-Projects
A place for all my Python, SQL and Tableau projects!
As of January 16, 2023, this repository contains: My capstone project and my Tableau project for my Data Analytics Bootcamp with Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies; an analysis of AirBnB data; an analysis of video games over the last several decades; an analysis of American baby names; and an analysis of international debt using a dataset from The World Bank. 
The capstone project is called the Shunique Business Case Study (using a dataset for the Shunique shoe store's sales). 
The Tableau project analyzes Halloween Trick or Treating trends between 2008 and 2019. 
The AirBnB analysis uses a dataset for AirBnB transactions for different neighborhoods in San Francisco for the year 2018. 
The video game analysis is a guided project from DataCamp using datasets that provide information about game sales and reviews from the 1980's to the 2020's.
The baby name analysis is a guided project from DataCamp using a single dataset with information about baby names and their popularity of the decades.
