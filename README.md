# Avery's-Projects
A place for all my Python, SQL and Tableau projects!
As of January 7, 2023, this repository contains my capstone project and my Tableau project for my Data Analytics Bootcamp with Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies. The capstone project is called the Shunique Business Case Study (using a dataset for the Shunique shoe store's sales). The Tableau project analyzes Halloween Trick or Treating trends between 2008 and 2019.
