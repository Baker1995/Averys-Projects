# Avery's-Projects
A place for all my Python, SQL and Tableau projects!
As of January 16, 2023, this repository contains my capstone project and my Tableau project for my Data Analytics Bootcamp with Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies, an analysis of AirBnB data, and an analysis of video games over the last four decades. The capstone project is called the Shunique Business Case Study (using a dataset for the Shunique shoe store's sales). The Tableau project analyzes Halloween Trick or Treating trends between 2008 and 2019. The AirBnB analysis uses a dataset for AirBnB transactions for different neighborhoods in San Francisco for the year 2018. The video game analysis is a guided project from DataCamp using datasets that provide information about game sales and reviews from the 1980's to the 2020's.
